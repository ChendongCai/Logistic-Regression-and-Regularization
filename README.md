# Logistic-Regression-and-Regularization

I built up a logistic regression model from scratch and compared this model with the built-in function in scikit-learn.

Also, I ran some experiments by adding different regularization terms and tuning the parameters to see the performance of logistic regression model on the given dataset.

I used part of the data provided by the World Bank to test the model.
